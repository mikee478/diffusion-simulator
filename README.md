### Project Description

Chemotaxis involves following a gradient in chemical signal concentrations toward reaching a target. Given a set of three chemicals (red, green, and blue), a controller applies chemicals to the map, and agents move in response to chemical stimuli. These chemicals diffuse throughout the grid over time. Further, there may be blocked cells in the grid that agents must move around. Your objective is to move your agents through the map to reach a target location as quickly as possible.
